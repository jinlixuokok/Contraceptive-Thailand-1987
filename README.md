This repo contains the necessary file and output results of Further Data Analysis Project based on TDHS, 1987

Abstract:      
    This article uses the data from the 1987 Thailand Demographic and Health Survey (hereinafter
referred to as TDHS), and extracts Table 4.8â€“Percent distribution of currently married woman aged 15-44
according to the contraceptive method currently used, by selected characteristics on page 75. , classify
and integrate the data in the table through statistical methods, aiming to restore the basis of the research
content in the paper, and further combine the social background and cultural environment at that time
to analyze the research results and draw conclusions.
